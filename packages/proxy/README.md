proxy
=====
### An HTTP proxy written with Node.js (think Squid)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides standard "HTTP proxy" logic. You can script your own server
using the `proxy` server API. Be sure to take a look at the "Examples" section
below.

There is also a companion `proxy(1)` CLI tool, which spawns an HTTP(s) proxy
server with the specified options.

You could think of `proxy(1)` as similar to some of the other popular open
source HTTP proxy software:

 * [Squid][]
 * [Privoxy][]
 * [Apache][] with [`mod_proxy`][mod_proxy]
 * [Moreâ€¦](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Web_proxy_servers)


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install proxy
```

If you would like to have the `proxy(1)` CLI program in your `$PATH`, then
install "globally":

``` bash
$ npm install -g proxy
```


Examples
--------

#### Basic HTTP(s) proxy server

A basic HTTP(s) server with all the default options. All requests are allowed.
CONNECT HTTP method works as well.

``` js
var http = require('http');
var setup = require('proxy');

var server = setup(http.createServer());
server.listen(3128, function () {
  var port = server.address().port;
  console.log('HTTP(s) proxy server listening on port %d', port);
});
```


CLI Tool Examples
-----------------

The `proxy(1)` CLI tool can be used to spawn HTTP(s) proxy server instances with
various options.

#### Port to bind to

Pass the `-p`/`--port` option to with a port number to specify a TCP port to
bind to. Defaults to __3128__ if none is specified.

``` bash
$ proxy --port 8080
```

#### Custom `Proxy-Authenticate` command

Pass the `-a`/`--authenticate` switch with a command to execute when the client
`Proxy-Authorization` header is given. This command determines whether or not the
request is authorized based on the "exit code" of the command.

The relevant request authentication information is passed in as
`PROXY_AUTH_USERNAME`, `PROXY_AUTH_PASSWORD` and `PROXY_AUTH_SCHEME` environment
variables.

For example, to authorize "Basic" authentication with username "foo" and
password "bar":

``` bash
$ proxy --authenticate 'if \
    [ "$PROXY_AUTH_USERNAME" = "foo" ] && \
    [ "$PROXY_AUTH_PASSWORD" = "bar" ]; \
      then exit 0; \
    fi; \
    exit 1;'
```

#### Custom outgoing interface

Pass the `-l`/`--local-address` argument with an IP address of the network
interface to send the outgoing requests through. It is the equivalent of setting
a `localAddress` field in the options when calling `http.request()`.

``` bash
$ proxy --local-address 192.168.0.10
```
